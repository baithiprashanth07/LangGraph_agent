## LangGraph Agent Implementation Todo

### Phase 1: Analyze project requirements (Completed)
- [x] Read and understand the `LangGraphAgentâ€“CodingTask.docx` document.
- [x] Identify key requirements: 11 stages, state persistence, deterministic/non-deterministic stages, MCP client integration (Atlas/Common).

### Phase 2: Set up project structure and dependencies
- [x] Create the main project directory `langgraph_agent`.
- [x] Create `src` directory for source code.
- [x] Create `config` directory for configuration files.
- [x] Create `tests` directory for test cases.
- [x] Create `docs` directory for documentation.
- [x] Create `requirements.txt` for Python dependencies.
- [x] Install necessary Python packages (langchain, langgraph, etc.).

### Phase 3: Implement core LangGraph agent functionality
- [x] Define the LangGraph state.
- [x] Implement each of the 11 stages as nodes in the LangGraph.
- [x] Implement deterministic stage execution.
- [x] Implement non-deterministic stage orchestration (DECIDE stage).
- [x] Implement MCP client integration (mock Atlas and Common servers).
- [x] Implement state persistence across stages.
- [x] Implement logging for stage execution and ability calls.

### Phase 4: Test and validate the implementation
- [x] Create a sample customer query JSON input.
- [x] Run the LangGraph agent with the sample input.
- [x] Verify the final structured payload output.
- [x] Verify logs show correct stage execution and ability calls.

### Phase 5: Create documentation and deliver results
- [x] Document the LangGraph agent configuration (JSON/YAML).
- [x] Document the working agent implementation.
- [x] Document the demo run (input, output, logs).
- [x] Prepare a README.md with instructions to run the agent.
